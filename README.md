<h2 id="data">Data Analysis</h2>

<p>All datasets for this project were obtained from <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710002001">Statistics Canada</a> and downloaded as <b>csv files</b>.</p>

<p>I wrote <b>python scripts</b> to automate the process of manipulating the csv files. In addition, I used python and the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"><b>pandas</b></a> software library to create a program which can convert the csv files to an HTML table which can be used to display the csv files on the follwing <a target="_blank" href="https://harman-khehara.github.io/">website.</a></p>

<p>The data analysis of the csv files was conducted using both <b>Microsoft Excel</b> and <b>R/RStudio</b>. I created <b>relevant graphs</b>, <b>boxplots</b> and obtained the <b>summary statistics</b> for each dataset to conduct the analysis.</p>

<h2 id="website">Website Development</h2>

<p>This website to display the findings of my research was developed using <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b> and the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"><b>Bootstrap</b></a> CSS framework to help create a responsive design. The website was developed in <b>VSCode</b></p>
